# **Electricity Load and Bill Estimator**

## **Project Overview**
The **Electricity Load and Bill Estimator** is a comprehensive tool designed to calculate electricity load (in kVA) and estimate the monthly electricity bill for users. The application integrates **Gemini API** for accurate and dynamic data exchange, providing insights into energy consumption and cost calculations. The tool is useful for both residential and commercial purposes to monitor and manage electricity usage efficiently.

## **Features**
- **kVA Calculation**: Estimate the required kVA for electrical installations based on load data.
- **Electricity Bill Estimation**: Calculate the estimated monthly electricity bill based on energy usage and applicable tariffs.
- **Gemini API Integration**: Real-time data integration for energy consumption patterns and tariffs.
- **User-friendly Interface**: A simple and intuitive interface to input data and get accurate results.
- **Energy Usage Analysis**: Analyze consumption trends over time with the help of real-time API data.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Backend**: Python (Flask)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Bootstrap for responsiveness)
- **Gemini API**: Integrated for fetching real-time data related to energy usage and tariffs.
- **Database**: SQLite (for storing user data and previous calculations, if required)

## **Installation and Setup**

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- pip (Python's package installer)
- A text editor or IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm)

### Steps to Set Up Locally

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Chinnuganesh/Electricity_load_and_bill_estimator.git
   cd Electricity_load_and_bill_estimator
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
   ```

3. **Install required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**:
   - For Gemini API, you'll need an API key. Make sure to set it in your environment variables:
     ```bash
     export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
     ```
   - For Windows, you can set the environment variable like this:
     ```bash
     set GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
     ```

5. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   This will start the Flask development server. You can now open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to access the application.

## **How It Works**
1. **kVA Calculation**:
   - The user inputs the total electrical load (in watts) of appliances or devices.
   - The application calculates the kVA required based on the formula:
     \[
     kVA = \frac{{\text{{Total Power (W)}}}}{{\text{{Voltage (V)}} \times \text{{Power Factor}}}}
     \]
2. **Bill Estimation**:
   - The user inputs the monthly energy consumption (in kWh).
   - The app fetches the latest tariff rates using the **Gemini API** and estimates the bill.
3. **Gemini API Integration**:
   - The Gemini API provides dynamic tariff data and energy consumption patterns, which are used to calculate the bill accurately.
   - The API updates energy consumption data in real-time.

## **Usage**
1. Open the application on your local server.
2. Enter the total electrical load in watts (for kVA calculation).
3. Enter the monthly energy consumption (in kWh).
4. Click the **Calculate** button to get the kVA and bill estimate.
